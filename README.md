## Youtube Music Carousel Transition

This is a simple example of how to implement a smooth carousel transition for a Youtube Music like experience, using react-native-skia and react-native-reanimated.

When swiping from one song to another, the background color transitions smoothly.60fps transition is achieved by driving transitions on the native thread using react-native-reanimated.

## How to run

1. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

2. Run the app

```bash
yarn start
```
